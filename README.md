# 281TwineProject
All source code and assets related to our twine project for the CSC 281 team project.

To run, simply navigate to the twine folder and open the All Eyes on Tartarus.html file in any modern web browser.

Currently WIP. Sensor game is partially implemented, while the story is still being planned in google docs. 
The sensor game will be changed in the future so the player is no longer directly controlling where missiles are shot. Instead, they will report information to a basic AI that will handle combat.

The source.txt file in the Assets folder details the source of every asset we use that was not produced by us. If something exists in assets but does not have a related source, it was created entirely by us.

If you play with High Dynamic Range enabled on Windows, you may notice some display ghosting and other oddities. If you toggle off HDR, default keybind Windows Key - Alt - B, these will go away.
