# A final note
### The game is HARD! Don't be surprised if you lose a lot!
Missiles fly fast, enemies will try to overwhelm you with fancy attacks and massive missile onslaughts, and your commanding officers need you to let them know where the enemy is so they can fire. It's always better to spend missiles than keep them in storage, but at the same time, don't waste shots. Reporting every single contact report might not be a bad idea, unless of course you're reporting lots of ghosts. Be mindful when you decide to spam-report that you don't run out of missiles. And when facing enemies with integrated laser point defense, don't both launching small salvos. The only thing that can consistently beat laser PD is a gigantic spread salvo or two fired back-to-back, or fired in tandem with an ally.
